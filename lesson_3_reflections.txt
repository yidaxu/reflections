1 When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

      When I need to work at anyother computer or want to publish my code.

2 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

		Maybe I don't want other people's code influence my current code.
